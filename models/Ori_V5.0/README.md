# V5
These were our most successful models. 

V5.0 and v5.1 are the same model (5.1 is a continuation of training), and achieved good orientation matching, but was prone to dropping the cube.

V5.2 and v5.3 were a different model (5.3 is a continuation of training), and achieved slightly better grip, but wasn't as consistent as 5.0 and 5.1. 

The best model for v5.0 is stored in the best model folder, and should (hopefully) yeild a fairly decent performance for orientation matching.
